            <p>Outside of work and study, I tend to spend my time outdoors in nature or socializing with friends. On the weekends I will typically be found surfing at North Curly and Queensie. During winter I tend to gravitate towards Perisher Resort as the beach gets a little cold. I would love to learn another language and have already pursued studies in French, but will place a higher focus on this during 2025.</p>
